FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use EXACTLY this structure for EVERY document:

=== SUMMARY FOR PATIENT ===

[Document Type] for [Patient Name]

[Main Purpose]

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- [Finding 1] → [Explanation]
- [Finding 2] → [Explanation]
- [Finding 3] → [Explanation]

**WHAT THIS MEANS:**
[1–2 sentence plain English interpretation]

**NEXT STEPS:**
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
- [Action 3]

2. PRESERVE THESE EXACTLY:
- The === header format with patient name
- Double newlines between sections
- Single newlines between list items
- Space before/after arrows ( → )
- ⚠️ for urgent items
- Patient name in ALL relevant sections

CONTENT RULES:
• Always include the patient's name naturally in the summary  
• Replace all medical jargon with simple terms  
• Never exceed 10 words per bullet point  
• Always specify if lab values are normal/abnormal  
• Use analogies for complex concepts  
• Maintain a compassionate, personalized tone

SPECIAL INSTRUCTION:
• If the document relates to mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, therapy), ADD a new section at the END with **at least 3 helpful tips** for emotional well-being:

**MENTAL HEALTH TIPS:**
- [Tip 1]
- [Tip 2]
- [Tip 3]

Use supportive, empathetic language and provide simple, actionable suggestions such as:
- Deep breathing or mindfulness techniques  
- Keeping a journal to track thoughts or moods  
- Reaching out to friends, family, or a therapist  
- Getting regular exercise and sleep  
- Limiting social media use if feeling overwhelmed
