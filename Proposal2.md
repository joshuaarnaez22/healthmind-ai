Research Focus
As part of my master's thesis, I will explore the following research questions:

How does gamification impact user engagement and retention in language learning platforms?

What is the effectiveness of AI-powered voices in improving pronunciation and language acquisition?

How can free, open-source platforms bridge the gap in language education accessibility?

The platform will serve as a case study, with user data and feedback used to analyze the impact of gamification and AI on learning outcomes.

Project Timeline
Phase 1: Research & Planning (1 Month)
Literature review on gamification and AI in education.

Define platform requirements and technical architecture.

Phase 2: Core Development (3-4 Months)
Build core features: AI voices, hearts system, points/XP system, basic lessons, and authentication.

Develop landing page and mobile responsiveness.

Phase 3: Gamification & Advanced Features (2-3 Months)
Implement leaderboard, quests, shop system, and character integration.

Build admin dashboard and integrate sound effects.

Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (1-2 Months)
Conduct beta testing with a small group of users.

Gather feedback and optimize the platform.

Phase 5: Launch & Data Collection (1 Month)
Launch the platform publicly.

Collect user data and feedback for research analysis.

Phase 6: Thesis Writing (2-3 Months)
Analyze data and write the master's thesis.

Expected Outcomes
A fully functional, free language learning platform accessible to users worldwide.

Insights into the effectiveness of gamification and AI in language education.

A master's thesis contributing to the fields of education technology and accessibility.

Budget
Since the platform is free and open-source, the primary costs will be for development tools and hosting:

ElevenLabs AI API: Free tier available (with potential upgrade for advanced features).

NeonDB: Free tier available for database hosting.

Vercel: Free tier available for deployment.

Clerk: Free tier available for authentication.

Total estimated cost: $0 (using free tiers of all services).

Conclusion
LingoForge represents an innovative approach to language learning, combining gamification, AI, and modern web technologies to create an engaging and accessible platform. As a master's project, it will not only provide a valuable tool for language learners but also contribute to academic research in education technology. By making language learning free and fun, LingoForge has the potential to empower millions of users worldwide.

Let’s forge a new path in language education together! 🌍🚀
