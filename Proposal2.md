Proposal for EcoAI: An AI-Powered Waste Management Platform
Executive Summary
EcoAI is an AI-powered waste management platform designed to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and community engagement. The platform offers public access features such as AI-assisted waste verification and an interactive leaderboard, as well as private access features for logged-in users, including a user reward system and real-time waste collection task management. Built with privacy and security as a top priority, EcoAI ensures all user data is encrypted and stored securely. This proposal outlines the project's objectives, features, methodology, and timeline.

Problem Statement
Traditional waste management systems often face inefficiencies in sorting, tracking, and engaging communities in proper waste disposal. Challenges such as lack of verification methods, delayed waste collection, and minimal incentives for eco-friendly behavior contribute to environmental degradation. EcoAI addresses these issues by leveraging AI to verify waste types, reward users for sustainable actions, and streamline waste collection operations in real time.

Objectives
Public Access Features:

Provide AI-assisted waste verification to classify and verify waste types.

Display an interactive leaderboard to foster community engagement and competition.

Private Access Features:

Implement a user reward system to encourage eco-friendly habits through points and redeemable incentives.

Enable real-time waste collection task management for optimized routes and notifications.

Privacy and Security:

Encrypt all user data and ensure secure authentication.

Maintain transparent privacy policies and provide users with control over their data.

Scope of Work
Public Access Features
AI-Assisted Waste Verification:

Use image recognition AI models to identify and classify waste items.

Provide real-time feedback on proper disposal methods.

Interactive Leaderboard:

Display rankings of individuals and communities based on eco-friendly activities.

Encourage competition and collective environmental responsibility.

Private Access Features
User Reward System:

Assign points for verified eco-friendly actions.

Allow users to redeem points for discounts or community incentives.

Real-Time Waste Collection Task Management:

Optimize waste collection routes using AI-powered logistics.

Provide real-time updates to users and waste collectors.

Optional Features
Community Dashboard:

Visualize community-wide waste management progress and trends.

Highlight top-performing neighborhoods or groups.

Methodology
Frontend:

Use Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.

Style the platform using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a modern, responsive UI.

Backend:

Use Supabase for authentication and database management.

Use Prisma for efficient database querying.

AI Integration:

Use TensorFlow.js or OpenAI for image recognition in waste classification.

Implement AI-powered logistics for route optimization.

Deployment:

Host the platform on Vercel for seamless CI/CD integration.
